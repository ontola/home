Titles:

- How Atomic Data could help us build a truly decentralized data system
- Atomic Data: a re-imagined, more practical sementic web
- Atomic Data: Towards type-safe, inherently sharable decentralized data

Intro's:

- Web is old, but still not very interoperable.
- Lots of lock-in

Internet designed as a decentralized network, where orgs and people hosted their own webpages
Now most of our data is stored by a small number of extremely large tech companies.
We want highly integrated tools, but in order to do this,
Every app it's own API
Browser only webpages, no structured data

## Why linked data could be awesome

The Semantic web paper.
Why you should want it
Why we invested in it.
What we learned

Why semantic web failed:

JSON won
Too much semantics, too little practical development
Lack of dev tools
RDF/XML was a bad choice

It's not just the tooling - it's the spec
