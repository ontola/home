title: "The GLAPP"
description: "A web application for Groenlinks, modernizing its online and offline campaigns."
color: "#347031"
challenge: "What do you do with campaigners going door to door? They need a route, where are they going to ring the bell? And most importantly - what do they do with the results? For this, GLAPP was developed."
solution: "In 2014 we started our e-democracy platform Argu.co, which aims to engage citizens in decision-making processes. We worked with many governments and hosted online discussions where people shared ideas, opinions and voted on issues. Although we've seen that e-democracy and civic participation can be very successful, one key element is often missing: the actual decision-making process."

## The question

As a political party, your members are your most important tool for growth.
What do you do with campaigners who go door-to-door?
They need a route, where are they going to ring the bell?
And above all - what do they do with the results? GLAPP was developed for this purpose.

## Our solution

We developed the _GLAPP_, the _Green Left App_.
This web application makes it easy for campaign managers to moderate online.

## Processing results

Results of the conversations volunteers have while going door-to-door are entered into the GLAPP. This updates the GroenLinks potential in that neighborhood. The data is always converted to an average on street level. As a result, no personal data is ever stored.
