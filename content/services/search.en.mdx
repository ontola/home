Searching for documents should be instantaneous. We've become used to great search experiences in our personal lives, but enterprise software often lags behind.

We specialize in building custom search experiences that are:

- **Fast**. Results appear as you type.
- **Relevant**. Using advanced ranking algorithms and semantic understanding.
- **Transparent**. Open source technologies without vendor lock-in.
- **Scalable**. From megabyte to petabyte scale!

## Technologies we love

We have extensive experience with the modern search stack:

- **Elasticsearch / Opensearch**. The industry standard for scalable, distributed search.
- **MeiliSearch**. An incredibly fast, typo-tolerant search engine perfect for user-facing applications.
- **Tantivy**. A high-performance embedded full-text search engine library written in Rust.
- **QuickWit**. For cost-efficient search on object storage (S3).
