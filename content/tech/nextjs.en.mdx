NextJS is a modern framework for building websites.
It combines the flexibility of modern web applications with the speed of static websites.
By making clever use of _Server Side Rendering_ (SSR), NextJS applications can be loaded very quickly into browsers.
NextJS uses the [React](/enl/tech/react) framework.
This builds websites with _components_, which are reusable.
This modular approach allows a NextJS website to grow.

This website is also built in NextJS.
You can [view the source code on Github](https://github.com/ontola/home).

## Why Use NextJS

- **Fast loading, fast clicking**. NextJS supports static site generation (SSG), server-side rendering (SSR), and client-side rendering (CSR). As a result, NextJS applications load extremely fast.
- **Better SEO**. Due to the short loading times, your pages rank better in search engines.
- **Works with virtually all back-ends**. NextJS works with various CMS systems and databases, such as Stripe, Contentful, [RESTFul APIs](/en/blog/api-design),
- **Easy Deployability**. Services like AWS Amplify and Vercel make hosting NextJS applications very fast.
- **Translations**. You can make NextJS websites work well in different languages.
- **Fast development**. NextJS is nice to work with because it allows you as a developer to get results at a fast pace.
- **Images**. NextJS converts images to the right sizes, without you having to optimize yourself when uploading. This saves time and keeps the website fast.

## Combine with...

You can choose to manage your NextJS application data as files in Git, but that's not useful if your content changes a lot, or if non-programmers need to be able to modify the content.
You can use services like [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/compose/building-a-website-with-compose/), or develop a custom back-end.

In the latter case we recommend Ruby on Rails:
