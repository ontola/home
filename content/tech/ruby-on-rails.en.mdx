Ruby on Rails is one of the most widely used Frameworks to write web applications with.
It is written in the Ruby programming language - a language that is very easy to read.

## Why use Rails

- **Many available libraries**. Thousands of libraries have been written for Ruby (and Rails), giving you a quick solution to many problems.
- **Fast development**. With Rails, you can build large, relatively complex applications in a short time.
- **Reliable**. Rails is used by many large software companies and has therefore proven itself considerably.
- Suitable for APIs**. You can create both full websites and APIs with Rails.

## Combine with...

Rails is primarily a server application, and thus (often) needs a front-end to display the data.
We recommend developing the front-end with [React](/enl/tech/reactjs).
