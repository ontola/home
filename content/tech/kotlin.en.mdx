Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language used by over 60% of professional Android developers that helps boost productivity, developer satisfaction, and code safety.

We love it for its conciseness, safety features (like null safety), and 100% compatibility with Java. It allows us to build robust and maintainable Android applications like our [SearchLauncher](/cases/searchlauncher).
