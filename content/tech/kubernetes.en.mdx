title: "Managing cloud environments with Kubernetes"
---

Managing software and the machines that are running it can be a challenge.
Kubernetes makes it easy to manage and deploy software on a cluster of machines.

## Why use Kubernetes?

We at Ontola use Kubernetes for most of our deployments.

- **Automate deployments**. Achieve continuous integration by deploying your software automatically and programmatically.
- **Easy scaling**. Grow or shrink your cluster of machines automatically, and only scale the applications that need it.
- **Self-healing**. Automatically restart containers that fail.
- **High compatibility**. Works with AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure, Google, and others.
- **Easier devops**. With Kubernetes, most of the logic and configuration required for managing your applications is stored in standardized, re-usable files.

## Need help?

The Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) and [tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) are a great place to start.
If you need any other help with Kubernetes to manage your devops, feel free to [get in touch](/contact)!
